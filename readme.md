This software is for doing computations on and related to Schubert
problems on Grassmannians. To use this software, you need four files:

* go.py
* galoistest.py
* tournament.py
* checkergame.py

The files "tournament.py" and "checkergame.py" are libraries. The
average user will do most computations from the functions found in
"galoistest.py", and the file "go.py" is for a specific experiment
performed by Frank Sottile, Abraham Mart√≠n del Campo and Christopher
Brooks. More details on the functions and operating instructions are
given in comments in the respective files, as well as the
documentation (which currently does not exist yet).
